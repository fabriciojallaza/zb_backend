# Catalog System REST API

###### Zebrands Backend Test

A RESTful API for a catalog system to manage products. The API is built using Django, Django REST Framework, SQLite, AWS SES, Swagger, Redoc. 

This system has two main models: Product and User. A Product has a sku, name, price, brand, creation date, edition date and amount of visits. A User has a username, email, password and creation date.

There are three types of users: admin, non-admin and anonymous. Admins can create, edit and delete products and other admin/users. Non-admins can view products without incrementing visits field of a product. Anonymous users can only read products.

If a product is updated an email is sent to all admins with the proper information. And a track of the number of visits is kept for each product when an anonymous user views it, business reports could be obtained from this information.

## Installation & Run

### Install requirements for Linux
It requires Python 3.7 or higher

~~~bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
sudo apt-get install git-all
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
~~~


### Clone the repository

~~~bash
# Mediante protocolo https
git clone https://github.com/fabriciojallaza/zb_backend.git

# Mediante protocolo ssh
git clone git@github.com:fabriciojallaza/zb_backend.git
~~~

### Create virtualenv

~~~bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
~~~

### Activate virtualenv

~~~bash
# For python >=3.10
source venv/local/bin/activate
# For python <3.10
source venv/bin/activate
~~~

### Install dependencies


#### Install requirements for virtualenv

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

#### Introduce your own settings for email configuration in settings.py file:
The deployed version uses AWS SES service to send emails. You can use your own email service or use the default SMTP service provided by Django.

~~~python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'your.host'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your.user'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your.password'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
~~~

#### Initialize setup
It creates an admin user and populates the database with some products.
~~~bash
python manage.py zb-setup
~~~

#### To Run Tests

~~~bash
python manage.py test
~~~

#### Run server

~~~bash
python manage.py runserver

# API Endpoint : http://127.0.0.1:8000

To login into the platform as admin, use the following credentials:

username: admin_user

password: admin_pass123

## Architecture Design
Django has a modular design that allows to create a scalable and maintainable architecture. It is an Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The Model is the data layer, the View is the presentation layer and the Controller is the logic layer. 
Each module has its own responsibilities and can be easily replaced by another module that performs the same function. Modules that produce data are separated from modules that consume data. This will to increase modifiability because changes are frequently confined to either the production or the consumption side of data.

The proposed architecture is based on the following diagram:
![Alt](/images/django_arch.png "Architecture")
The flux of data is from left to right. The HTTP request interacts with the view, the view interacts with the controller/serializer and the controller/serializer interacts with the model. The model interacts with the database and the database interacts with the model. 
It is built to be escalable and maintanaible since each module has its own app and the connection between them is done through the urls.py file. Where other modules can be added. User app can be customized to have more type of users and the third existing one, where a registered user could access fiew admin options. Each module has dates of creation and edition to keep control and can be implemented the username that made the changes.


# Deployment
The API is deployed in AWS EC2 instance. The instance is configured to run the API using gunicorn and nginx. The API is served in the following endpoint: [Catalog System API Online - AWS EC2](http://ec2-3-93-152-219.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/)

To login into the platform and test the API or make it in the localhost, follow this link: [Catalog System Docs](http://ec2-3-93-152-219.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/docs/)

1. Click on the "Login" button
![Alt](/images/zp_api_docs.png "API Docs")
2. Introduce your credentials
![Alt](/images/login.png "Login")
3. Copy the token and go back to the API [Docs](http://ec2-3-93-152-219.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/docs/)
4. Click on the "Authorize" button and paste the token with the word "Token" before the token
![Alt](/images/token_auth.png "Authorize")
5. Now you can test the API
